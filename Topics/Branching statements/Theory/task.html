<h2>Break and continue. Branching</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>In certain cases, you may want to alter the standard behavior of a loop. The Java programming language provides <strong>branching statements</strong> for this purpose that can terminate a loop or skip some of its iterations. Proper use of these statements is essential for writing clear, organized, and efficient code.</p><h5 id="the-break-statement">The break statement</h5><p>The <strong>break</strong> statement has two uses:</p><ul><li><p>it terminates the current loop of any type (<strong>for</strong>, <strong>while</strong>, <strong>do-while</strong>);</p></li><li><p>it terminates a case in the <strong>switch</strong> statement;</p></li></ul><p>In this topic, we will learn how to use it to terminate loops.</p><p>The following example demonstrates a loop that includes one <code class="language-java">break</code>.</p><pre><code class="language-java">int i = 10;
while (true) { // the condition to continue the loop
    if (i == 0) { // the condition to perform the break that stops this loop 
        break;
    }
    i--;
}</code></pre><p>In the code above, the condition to continue the loop is always <code class="language-java">true</code>, but it will be successfully stopped when the variable <code class="language-java">i</code> becomes <code class="language-java">0</code> through the use of <code class="language-java">break</code> inside the conditional statement.</p><p>The <strong>break</strong> statement terminates only the loop in which it is currently located. If this loop is performed inside another loop, the outer loop won't be stopped.</p><p>The following code prints a ladder of numbers.</p><pre><code class="language-java">for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j &lt; 10; j++) {
        System.out.print(j + " ");
        if (i == j) {
            break;
        }
    }
    System.out.println();
}</code></pre><p>The break statement can't stop the outer loop (with variable <code class="language-java">i</code>) and the code prints:</p><pre><code class="language-java">0 
0 1 
0 1 2 
0 1 2 3 
0 1 2 3 4 
0 1 2 3 4 5 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 </code></pre><p>To stop the outer loop we could declare a Boolean variable <code class="language-java">stopped</code> and use it as a special Boolean flag.</p><pre><code class="language-java">boolean stopped = false;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10 &amp;&amp; !stopped; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j &lt; 10; j++) {
        System.out.print(j + " ");
        if (i == j) {
            stopped = true;
            break;
        }
     }
    System.out.println();
}</code></pre><p>Now, the program's output is not the same:</p><pre><code class="language-java">0</code></pre><p>There is another way to stop the outer loop: the labeled break operator. However, it's not good practice to use it. Google it if you are really interested.</p><p> Here's an example demonstrating the use of <code class="language-java">break</code> with a label:</p><pre><code class="language-java">outerLoop:
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j &lt; 10; j++) {
        System.out.print(j + " ");
        if (i == j) {
            break outerLoop; // Break out of both loops.
        }
    }
    System.out.println();
}</code></pre><p> </p><h5 id="the-continue-statement">The continue statement</h5><p>It causes a loop to skip the current iteration and go to the next one.</p><p>This statement can be used inside any kind of loop.</p><ul><li><p>inside the <strong>for-loop</strong>, the continue statement causes control to immediately move to the increment/decrement statement;</p></li><li><p>inside the <strong>while</strong> or<strong> do-while loop</strong>, control immediately moves to the condition.</p></li></ul><p>In the following example, a sequence of numbers is output. Odd numbers are skipped.</p><pre><code class="language-java">int n = 10;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
    if (i % 2 != 0) {
        continue;
    }
    System.out.print(i + " ");
}</code></pre><p>The output:</p><pre><code class="language-java">0 2 4 6 8</code></pre><p>The <strong>continue </strong>statement and the <strong>break </strong>statement only affect the loop in which they are located. The <strong>continue </strong>statement cannot skip the current iteration of the outer loop.</p><p>Often, we can rewrite our loop without using the continue statement. Here is an example:</p><pre><code class="language-java">int n = 10;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) { 
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
        System.out.print(i + " ");
    } 
}</code></pre><p>The result is the same as above, but the code became shorter and more readable.</p><p>It is important to note that the widespread use of branching statements leads to poorly-structured code because conditions in your loops are not actually what you need to do. So, use them wisely â€” only when it helps to make code shorter and easier to understand for humans.</p><h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5><p>The <strong>break </strong>statement allows for the termination of loops or switch cases based on certain conditions. It can be a valuable tool for controlling the flow of your program, especially when you need to exit loops prematurely. On the other hand, the continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next one. It is useful for situations where you want to skip specific iterations based on certain conditions. However, it's essential to exercise caution when using these statements. Overuse of branching statements can lead to code that is challenging to read and maintain. Therefore, it's recommended to employ them sparingly, primarily when it enhances code clarity and conciseness.</p>
